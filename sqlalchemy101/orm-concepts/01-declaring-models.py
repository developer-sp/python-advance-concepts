# ------------- Base Class and Mapped Classes -------------
# After creating the Base class, we can individual mapped classes that inherit this base class
# Each Mapped Class is a Table the name of which is indicated by using the __tablename__ class-level attribute.

# Next, columns that are part of the table are declared, by adding attributes that include a special 
# typing annotation called Mapped. The name of each attribute corresponds to the column that is to be part of the database table.

# The datatype of each column is taken first from the Python datatype that’s associated with each Mapped 
# annotation; int for INTEGER, str for VARCHAR, etc. Nullability derives from whether or not the Optional[] type modifier is used.

# This is a Mapped Class, it creates a table called "user_account"
